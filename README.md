# Airbnb-New-York-Guest-Guide
## An interactive website provides guest guides, such as finding ideal listings or neighborhood reviews, for travelers, using the R Shiny App.

- More details:
  - Our project aims to simplify and aid the searching process for Airbnb guests through our website. Guests can obtain housing and location information by putting simple  inputs into our app and clicking one button. It may be a daunting task for travelers to target the most ideal place to stay via Airbnb, as it provides so many listing options. It is time-consuming for the guests to scan through miscellaneous listings, and collect fragmented information from the Airbnb website. We determined the vital elements that guests will consider—for example, listing locations, price, number of people that a location can accommodate, and amenities— and then leveraged appropriate visualization approaches to display the relationship between these elements to provide comprehensive information to guests. Furthermore, we conducted a price prediction to provide an additional decision-making reference.
